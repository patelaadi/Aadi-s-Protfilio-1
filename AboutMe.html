    Hi my name is Aadi Patel. I am a sophmore in high school, I am 16 years old.
    I play tennis for my hight school. I love to draw many different things like characters
    and animals. lately I've had the enjoyment of making games with the Unity engine and
    learning how to use the inbuilt functions and features. Soon I wish to make a fully fleged game on Unity
    with the skills that i have learned from coding for so long.
